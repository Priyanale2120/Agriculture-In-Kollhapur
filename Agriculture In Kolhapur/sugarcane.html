        <h1>SUGRACANE</h1>
       <p >Sugarcane was planted over 1.52 lakh hectares in Kolhapur.There are total 27 sugarcane factories in Kolhapur district.
        Sugarcane farmers of kolhapur itself bring in approximately 13 billion to the economy. Sugar from this region is exported all across india and abroad.
        Kolhapur region is one of the most concentrated sugarcane growing area in Maharashtra state because of favourable soil and agro ecological condition of the region. Kolhapur's climate is a blend 
        of coastal and inland elements common to Maharashtra.
        Sugarcane stalks grow to between 2 and 6 meters tall. These stalks contain sugar, which is used to sweeten food and drinks. After the sugar has been taken out the remains of the stalks can be burned to generate heat and electricity. It can also be made into paper, cardboard and cutlery.</p>
         <p>This crop requires high temperature and high rainfall. In areas of low rainfall this crop is cultivated with the help of irrigation. Black soil or alluvial soil is the best for this crop. Sugarcane requires a large amount of water. That is why holding deep soil is required. As this crop absorbs nutrient matter from the soil, compost manure and chemical fertilizers are used. It wants 75-100cm rainfall.
